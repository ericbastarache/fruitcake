          <p class="about-text">{{title}} was created as a way to solve a problem with freelancing; finding good work and not getting robbed of your hard earned money. Other platforms take a large chunk of money when you're first starting out and gradually decrease it as time goes by. We're different. We take the same percentage out every time, regardless of whether you're new to freelancing or a grizzled veteran.</p>
